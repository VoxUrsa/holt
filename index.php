We are one of the few Christmas tree retailers in Southern California that specializes in extra large and extra tall trees. And because we will deliver our trees from San Diego to Santa Barbara, we have become Southern California's premiere commercial sale Christmas tree lot.
<br><br>
Over the span of 60 years, parents have brought their children, and now their grandchildren, to our lots to select their family Christmas tree. It is our hope that our family tradition will become your family tradition this holiday season.

          <p class="text-size-14 text-dark">It is important to our family that we provide our customers with the freshest, best quality Christmas trees. To ensure that you receive the freshest Christmas tree possible, we water and care for our trees daily. Throughout the month of December, we frequently receive shipments of freshly cut trees. And even to this day, Oliver Holt along with his sons and crew, travel to the mountains of Northern California to hand-select and cut many of our trees. </p>
